# OneFlow - git extension

This project is a GitFlow replacement due to the overhead of GitFlow and its downsides like an unreadable git history. The scripts are based on the branching model described in [this blog article over at End of Line](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow).

## Install/Uninstall
To install the extension please clone the repository and start the install script. There is a seperate uninstall.sh file for uninstalling/removing everything.

```
# clone repo
git clone git@github.com:LeaveAirykson/git-oneflow.git

# install script
. install.sh

# uninstall script
. uninstall.sh
```
