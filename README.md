# Oneflow git extension

This project is a GitFlow replacement due to the overhead of GitFlow and its downsides like an unreadable git history. The scripts are based on the branching model described in [this blog article over at End of Line](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow).

## Install
To install the script please clone the repository and start the install script.

```
git clone 
```
